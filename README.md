🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Model

This repository contains a classic machine learning classification project that analyzes the fate of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived or perished based on features like age, passenger class, and gender.

The analysis is conducted entirely within the provided Jupyter Notebook.

.

🌟 Project Highlights

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values in features like Age and Fare, and encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked).

Feature Engineering: Creating new features (e.g., FamilySize and IsAlone) to improve model performance.

Model Implementation: Training a Logistic Regression model (or another suitable classification model, based on the notebook's content).

Cross-Validation: Assessing model reliability and generalization using k-fold cross-validation.

Evaluation: Reporting key classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.
