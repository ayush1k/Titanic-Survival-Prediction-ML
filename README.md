🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction ModelThis repository contains a classic machine learning classification project that analyzes the fate of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The goal is to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived or perished based on features like age, passenger class, and gender.The analysis is conducted entirely within the provided Jupyter Notebook.🌟 Project HighlightsData Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values in features like Age and Fare, and encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked).Feature Engineering: Creating new features (e.g., FamilySize and IsAlone) to improve model performance.Model Implementation: Training a Logistic Regression model (or another suitable classification model, based on the notebook's content).Cross-Validation: Assessing model reliability and generalization using k-fold cross-validation.Evaluation: Reporting key classification metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, and Recall.🛠 Project Structure and FilesFileDescriptiontitanic-survival.ipynbThe Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for data loading, EDA, preprocessing, model training, cross-validation, and final evaluation.requirements.txt(Recommended to be created) Lists all necessary Python dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc.).🚀 How to Run the ProjectThe notebook relies on the standard Titanic dataset (often found as train.csv and test.csv in a Kaggle environment).1.
